## Header

Hello.
I am an assistant professor of Information & Interaction Design.

My main research interests lie in machine learning/deep learning in psychological contexts
relevant to design.

I am also a coffee roaster, wine lover, and friend of all young dogs.

I love learning new stuff.

Artificial intelligence was particularly exciting for me.
But being a foodie, exploring the world in all its authentic food is still exciting to me.
